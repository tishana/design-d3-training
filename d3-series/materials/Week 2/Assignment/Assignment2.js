// My Assignment 2 solutions
// Part 1 cars.json
//     - How many makes are considered common (where property make_is_common is 1)

//     - How many makes are there per country.

//     - How many makes are there by country and broken down by common and uncommon

// Part 2 pokemon.json
//     - Calculate the average weight (lbs) and height (in inches) of the pokemon. Note you will have to convert the units to lbs and inches. 

//     - What is the total egg distance (value on egg property) for all pokemon who have a weakness of 'Psychic'. 'Weaknesses' is a property on each pokemon object that contains a list of strings. Note: some 'egg' properties say 'Not in Eggs'. consider this value a -1 in your summation.

//     - Determine which type of pokemon has the most weaknesses on average. List the types of pokemon and the number of their weaknesses in a list in descending order. Note: a pokemon can have more than one type. Because of this the same pokemon can be counted for more than one type. For example: the first object with id:1 would count as both 'Grass' and 'Poison' type.

//     - break the pokemon down into 5 equal buckets of weight classes and then average the spawn_time (show in minutes) of each weight class
